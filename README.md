# Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation

## Overview
This project is all about building a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Python. The BST supports:
- **Inserting values** into the tree
- **Searching** for values
- **Deleting nodes** (handling all cases: leaf, one child, two children)
- **In-order traversal** to get values in sorted order

I also wrote **unit tests** to make sure everything works as expected, covering common operations and edge cases like trying to delete something that’s not in the tree or inserting duplicate values.
